## django-admin startproject mypage

    - Creates a new Django project named "mypage".
    - Makes a folder "mypage" containing:
        manage.py        -> tool to run project commands (runserver, migrate, startapp, ...)
        mypage/          -> project settings package
            __init__.py  -> marks the folder as a Python package
            settings.py  -> project configuration (installed apps, database, etc.)
            urls.py      -> main URL routes of the site
            asgi.py      -> entry point for async web servers
            wsgi.py      -> entry point for regular web servers
